I wasn't planning on reading this book, but we were staying at my mother-in-law's for Christmas and I had only brought a non-fiction book that was boring me. I thought the title sounded interested and I hadn't heard of the author. Apparently that's enough to pique my curiosity these days[1].

It's worth mentioning upfront that although this book can probably be found in the Fantasy section of your favourite bookshop/library, it lacks some of the genre's most popular elements such as magic, legendary heroes, mythical creatures, etc. It is set in a fictional but run-of-the-mill medieval-ish city with its castle and walls.

The story is a first person account of the defence of a walled city under siege by a man named Orhan, who's the colonel of engineers in charge of building bridges around the empire. The best way of describing it I can think of is a mix between Game of Throne's Battle of the Blackwater (when Tyrion is in charge of defends King's Landing) and The Martian. The protagonist has a great sense of humour, very dry and self-deprecating. I pictured him more like Davos Seaworth than Tyrion Lannister or Mark Watney.

I say it reminds me of The Martian because of the focus on detailed explanations of the mechanisms of catapults, the tensile strength of the wooden arm of a trebuchet and how to counter-mine an enemy that is trying to make your walls collapse. If you enjoy technical-minded science fiction, this book is a lot closer to it than to your average fantasy book (if more stories like this exist, please let me know!). You can clearly tell the author knows what he's talking about. I would bet he's a hobbyist woodworker.

I wouldn't recommend this book if you are looking for great story or world building. All other characters apart from Orhan are pretty flat and barely get any development (my favourite was Sawdust, the super-ingenius carpenter). I also thought the random bits of world building, mainly namedropping different nationalities and allegiances weren't developed enough to become interesting or add to the background of the story[2]. It also kept making attempts to add a racial component to the conflict (Orhan describes himself as a "milkface", which seemed to be a discriminated minority) but it fell a bit flat for my taste, I just ignored it.

This book was a very pleasant surprise, it hits the right spot with the engineering stuff if that's your sort of thing, it's funny and very well-paced. No fluff, no trilogy of 400+ page bricks. I was initially suspicious of the unreliability of the narrator but, without spoiling the ending, it gets addressed in a satisfactory way. I will definitely check out other books by K.J. Parker[3].

### Footnotes

1. I originally wrote "peak my curiosity" and it looked wrong so I searched for it. Learned somethine new (also English is a mess).
2. I have the suspicion that the author has many other books set in this world and I just haven't read them.
3. K.J. Parker is the pseudonym of Tom Holt, a British author I also haven't heard of.
