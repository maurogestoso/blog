In an effort to consume media in a more intentional way, I'm going to experiment with sharing and writing a bit about the articles I read/podcasts I listen/videos I watch every week.

### 1. How to solve climate change and make life more awesome

üéô[The Ezra Klein Show](https://pca.st/7h1x5bjg)

This is one of the most sensible, well thought and balanced conversations I've heard on what we can do about the climate crisis. Saul Griffith gives an excellent overview of how we can decarbonise the energy production of the planet, the trade-offs of controversial options such as nuclear power or geo-engineering and the policies governments should adopt. But the most important message for me was that we can tackle all these problems and make a better society at the same time. We did it in the past and we have all the technology we need. Convincing our leaders to get their shit together is another story...

## 2. The modern web is becoming an unusable, user-hostile wasteland

üìù[Abid Omar](https://omarabid.com/the-modern-web)

The author explains - using Facebook, Twitter and Medium as examples - how bad the user experience is on the modern web's most popular sites. I completely agree with all of his points, we are slowly ruining the web by converting every single site into fenced, data-collecting advertising machines. Have you tried accessing a website from your mobile phone lately? This article was great motivation to continue publishing content in my own website rather than throwing it away into the vortex of a company that doesn't care about their users.

## 3. Jules Verne deserves a better translation service

üìù[The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2007/sep/11/julesvernedeservesabetter)

I grew up reading Jules Verne novels, he's probably why I got interested in science and technology from a young age. I feel very naive that it never occurred to me that translators of books would have agendas (and not good ones). I wonder if the Spanish translations I read as a child had the same problems. I kind of want to learn French to be able to read his novels as he wrote them, especially all those technical bits that were left out. If you like Jules Verne I can't recommend enough [The Books of Babel by Josiah Bancroft](http://www.thebooksofbabel.com/).
